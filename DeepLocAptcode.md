The Strategy: Incremental & Coordinated

Upgrade through LTS versions: 8 → 11 → 17 → 21.
Golden Rule: At each step, upgrade shared-lib FIRST, build & publish it, then upgrade the producer and consumer, updating their dependency on the new shared-lib.

The Plan:

    Preparation (All Repos):
        Branch: Create a feature/java-21-upgrade branch in each repo.
        Audit: Check dependency compatibility (Kafka, etc.) for Java 11, 17, 21 & Spring Boot 3.
        Test: Ensure you have strong test coverage.
        JDKs: Install JDK 11, 17, and 21.

    Upgrade to Java 11:
        Shared-Lib: Update build.gradle (sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_11), add JAXB/Java EE deps if needed. Build & Publish.
        Producer/Consumer: Update build.gradle to Java 11, update shared-lib dependency. Build & Test.
        Merge Java 11 changes.

    Upgrade to Java 17 & Spring Boot 3 (The Big One):
        Gradle: Upgrade to 8.x (./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version 8.x).
        Shared-Lib:
            Update build.gradle (Spring Boot 3.2+, JavaLanguageVersion.of(17)).
            Crucial: Migrate javax.* to jakarta.* (use OpenRewrite/IDE).
            Update all dependencies. Build & Publish.
        Producer/Consumer: Update build.gradle (SB 3.2+, Java 17), jakarta, shared-lib dependency. Build & Test.
        Merge Java 17 changes.

    Upgrade to Java 21:
        Shared-Lib: Update build.gradle (JavaLanguageVersion.of(21)). Build & Publish.
        Producer/Consumer: Update build.gradle to Java 21, update shared-lib dependency. Build & Test.
        (Optional): Enable Virtual Threads (spring.threads.virtual.enabled=true).
        Merge Java 21 changes.

    Final Steps:
        Integration Test: Run full end-to-end tests.
        CI/CD: Update Jenkinsfile & Dockerfile to use JDK 21.
        Deploy: Release to staging, then production, monitoring closely.
